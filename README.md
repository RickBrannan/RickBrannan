## Employer(s)

* **[BiblioNexus](https://biblionexus.org).** This is my full-time gig. We're working to eradicate Bible poverty with open source software that helps church-centric teams translate the Bible faster and better.
* **[Clear Team at Biblica](https://clear.bible).** I work limited part-time hours on contract for Biblica. I work on creating and refining existing Greek and Hebrew linguistic data in support of Bible translation. Teams (like BiblioNexus) use this data as a foundation for several things.
* **You.** I have some ability to take on contract work. If you're looking for some data wrangling or even some proofing or editing, hit me up.

## Other stuff

I write. I research. Some of the output of that work is available as public repos here.

## What am I doing now?

My current non-work focus (so, no BiblioNexus or Biblica involvement) is research and writing for the _Baylor Handbook on the Apostolic Fathers_ volume(s) on the _Shepherd of Hermas_. I've got a draft of the Visions together and am (slowly but surely) working on a content review. Lots of work left to do here.
