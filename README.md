# Rick Brannan

## Employer(s)

* **[BiblioNexus](https://biblionexus.org).** This is my full-time gig. We're working to eradicate Bible poverty with open source software that helps church-centric teams translate the Bible faster and better. Check out my recent work in the [openly-licensed ACAI dataset](https://github.com/BibleAquifer/ACAI) which includes information on people and places in the Bible, and so much more.
* **[Appian Way Press](https://github.com/AppianWayPress).** The Appian Way Press is a side venture of mine that is focused on producing accurate, readable translations of ancient Christian works using machine translation techniques. [Sponsor me on github](https://github.com/sponsors/RickBrannan) with a regular monthly amount or even try sponsoring a whole work (like Athenagoras' _De Resurrectione_)!
* **You.** I also have the ability to take on contract work. If you're looking for some data wrangling or translation work, or even some proofing or editing, hit me up.

## Other stuff

I write. I research. Some of the output of that work is available as public repos here.

## What am I doing now?

My current non-work focus (so, no BiblioNexus) is research and writing for the _Baylor Handbook on the Apostolic Fathers_ volume(s) on the _Shepherd of Hermas_. I've got a draft of the Visions together and am (slowly but surely) working on the Mandates. Lots of work left to do here.
